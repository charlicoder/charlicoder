                                full-stack applications, where I honed my skills
                                on everything from B2B procurement systems to
                                mission-critical geospatial platforms for the US

                                Throughout my career, I've embraced the
                                challenge of engineering complex, scalable
                                solutions. I've designed and optimized
                                large-scale ETL pipelines on AWS, engineered
                                high-performance vector search systems with
                                FastAPI and Pinecone, and modernized legacy
                                systems to enhance performance and
                                maintainability. My expertise is rooted in
                                building resilient, cloud-native architectures
                                using Docker, Kubernetes, and a wide array of
                                AWS services to support both real-time and
                                asynchronous workloads.

                                Today, my focus is at the intersection of
                                full-stack development and artificial
                                intelligence. I am passionate about building the
                                next generation of intelligent applications,
                                from developing AI-powered chatbots with
                                LangChain and RAG-based systems to creating
                                AI-driven marketing automation tools. I thrive
                                on leveraging modern tech stacks like Next.js
                                and FastAPI to build sophisticated solutions
                                that solve real-world problems and deliver
                                tangible business value.

                                learning, contributing to open-source projects,

                                that can solve real-world problems.
